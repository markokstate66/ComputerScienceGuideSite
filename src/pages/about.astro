        <h1>About Computer Science Guide</h1>

        <p class="intro">
          Computer Science Guide is a free educational resource dedicated to helping people learn
          programming and computer science fundamentals, regardless of their background.
        </p>

        <AdUnit slot="in-article" />

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe quality computer science education should be accessible to everyone. Our goal
          is to provide clear, comprehensive guides that take you from complete beginner to job-ready
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many resources that assume prior knowledge, we explain concepts from first principles.
          Every guide is written with the assumption that you're encountering the topic for the first time.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structured Learning Paths:</strong> Follow our roadmap from fundamentals to advanced topics</li>
          <li><strong>In-Depth Guides:</strong> Comprehensive tutorials with code examples and practice exercises</li>
          <li><strong>Curated Resources:</strong> Recommendations for books, courses, and tools</li>
          <li><strong>Interview Preparation:</strong> Tips and practice for landing your first tech job</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Each guide follows a consistent structure:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Explain the "why":</strong> Understanding when and why to use a concept</li>
          <li><strong>Clear examples:</strong> Practical code samples you can run and modify</li>
          <li><strong>Visual aids:</strong> Diagrams and illustrations where helpful</li>
          <li><strong>Practice exercises:</strong> Reinforce learning through hands-on problems</li>
          <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> Clear path to continue learning</li>
        </ol>
