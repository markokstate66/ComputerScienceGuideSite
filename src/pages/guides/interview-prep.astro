  <p class="intro">
    Technical interviews can be challenging, but with the right preparation strategy, you can
    walk in confident and showcase your abilities. This guide covers everything from resume
    optimization to acing the final rounds.
  </p>

  <h2 id="overview">The Interview Process</h2>
  <p>Most tech companies follow a similar hiring process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Application/Referral:</strong> Resume screening</li>
    <li><strong>Recruiter Screen:</strong> 15-30 min call about background and role</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Phone Screen:</strong> 45-60 min coding interview</li>
    <li><strong>Onsite/Virtual Interviews:</strong> 4-6 hours of interviews
      <ul>
        <li>2-3 coding rounds</li>
        <li>1 system design round (for senior roles)</li>
        <li>1-2 behavioral rounds</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Offer/Negotiation:</strong> Compensation discussion</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="resume">Resume & Application</h2>

  <h3>Resume Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One page:</strong> Unless you have 10+ years of experience</li>
    <li><strong>Clear format:</strong> Easy to scan, consistent styling</li>
    <li><strong>Action verbs:</strong> Led, Built, Improved, Implemented, Designed</li>
    <li><strong>Quantify impact:</strong> Numbers make achievements concrete</li>
    <li><strong>Relevant skills:</strong> Match job description keywords</li>
    <li><strong>No typos:</strong> Have others proofread</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Writing Strong Bullet Points</h3>
  <pre><code>{`❌ Weak: "Worked on the search feature"

✅ Strong: "Implemented full-text search using Elasticsearch,
reducing query latency by 60% and improving user engagement by 25%"

Formula: [Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Technology/Method] + [Impact/Result]

Examples:
• Reduced API response time by 40% by implementing Redis caching layer
• Built CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, cutting deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes
• Led migration of 500K users from legacy system to microservices architecture
• Mentored 3 junior developers, resulting in 2 promotions within 6 months`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Resume Sections</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Contact Info:</strong> Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio</li>
    <li><strong>Summary (optional):</strong> 2-3 sentences for experienced candidates</li>
    <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Most recent first, 3-5 bullet points each</li>
    <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Especially important for new grads</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Degree, school, graduation year, relevant coursework</li>
    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Languages, frameworks, tools (avoid rating yourself)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Problem-Solving Framework</h3>
  <pre><code>{`1. UNDERSTAND (2-3 minutes)
   • Repeat the problem back
   • Ask clarifying questions
   • Confirm input/output format
   • Discuss edge cases

2. PLAN (3-5 minutes)
   • Think out loud
   • Consider multiple approaches
   • Analyze time/space complexity
   • Choose approach and explain why

3. IMPLEMENT (15-20 minutes)
   • Write clean, readable code
   • Use meaningful variable names
   • Comment if logic is complex
   • Keep talking through your code

4. TEST (3-5 minutes)
   • Walk through with a simple example
   • Test edge cases (empty, single element, duplicates)
   • Fix bugs if found

5. OPTIMIZE (if time permits)
   • Discuss potential improvements
   • Trade-offs between time and space`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Example Problem Walkthrough</h3>
  <pre><code>{`Problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of two numbers that add up to target.

Step 1: UNDERSTAND
"So I need to find two different numbers in the array that sum to the target,
and return their indices. Can there be multiple valid pairs? Should I return
the first one found? Can the array have duplicates?"

Step 2: PLAN
"Brute force would be O(n²) with nested loops. But I can use a hash map to
store numbers I've seen, giving O(n) time and O(n) space."

Step 3: IMPLEMENT`}</code></pre>

  <pre><code>{`def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # value -> index

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num

        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]

        seen[num] = i

    return []  # No solution found`}</code></pre>

  <pre><code>{`Step 4: TEST
"Let me trace through [2, 7, 11, 15] with target 9:
- i=0: num=2, complement=7, not in seen, add 2:0
- i=1: num=7, complement=2, 2 IS in seen at index 0
- Return [0, 1] ✓"

Step 5: OPTIMIZE
"This is already O(n) time and O(n) space. We could sort and use two pointers
for O(n log n) time and O(1) space if we didn't need indices."`}</code></pre>

  <h2 id="system-design">System Design</h2>
  <p>
    System design interviews assess your ability to design large-scale systems.
    They're typically asked for senior or mid-level positions.
  </p>

  <h3>System Design Framework</h3>
  <pre><code>{`1. REQUIREMENTS (5 minutes)
   Functional: What should the system do?
   Non-functional: Scale, latency, availability, consistency

2. ESTIMATIONS (5 minutes)
   Users, requests/second, storage needs, bandwidth

3. HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN (10 minutes)
   Draw main components: clients, servers, databases, caches

4. DETAILED DESIGN (15 minutes)
   Dive deep into 2-3 components based on interviewer interest

5. SCALING & TRADE-OFFS (10 minutes)
   Identify bottlenecks, discuss solutions, trade-offs`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Common System Design Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)</li>
    <li>Design Twitter/Instagram feed</li>
    <li>Design a chat application</li>
    <li>Design a rate limiter</li>

  <h2 id="behavioral">Behavioral Questions</h2>
  <p>
    Behavioral interviews assess soft skills, culture fit, and how you've handled
    past situations. Use the STAR method to structure your answers.
  </p>

  <h3>The STAR Method</h3>
  <pre><code>{`S - Situation: Set the context (brief)
T - Task: What was your responsibility?
A - Action: What specifically did YOU do?
R - Result: What was the outcome? (quantify if possible)

Example:
Q: "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a teammate."

S: "On my last project, a senior developer and I disagreed about
   whether to use GraphQL or REST for our new API."

T: "As the tech lead, I needed to make a decision that the team
   could align on while considering both technical and timeline constraints."

A: "I organized a meeting where we both presented our cases with
   concrete criteria: learning curve, team familiarity, and project
   requirements. I created a decision matrix and we evaluated each
   option objectively."

R: "We chose REST due to team expertise and tighter deadline. The
   senior dev appreciated the fair process, and we delivered on time.
   We documented GraphQL as a future consideration."`}</code></pre>

  <h3>Common Behavioral Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tell me about yourself (have a 2-minute pitch ready)</li>
    <li>Why do you want to work here?</li>
    <li>Describe a challenging project you worked on</li>
    <li>Tell me about a time you failed/made a mistake</li>
    <li>How do you handle disagreements with teammates?</li>
    <li>Describe a time you had to learn something quickly</li>
    <li>Tell me about a time you went above and beyond</li>
    <li>How do you prioritize when you have multiple deadlines?</li>
    <li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>
    <li>Do you have any questions for me? (always ask questions!)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions to Ask Interviewers</h3>
  <pre><code>{`About the role:
• What does a typical day look like?
• What would success look like in the first 90 days?
• What are the biggest challenges facing the team?

About the team:
• How is the team structured?
• What's the code review process like?
• How do you handle technical debt?

About growth:
• What learning opportunities are available?
• How does the promotion process work?
• Can you tell me about someone who's grown in this role?

About culture:
• How would you describe the engineering culture?
• What do you enjoy most about working here?
• How does the team celebrate wins?`}</code></pre>
